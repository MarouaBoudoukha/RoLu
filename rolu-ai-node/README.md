Mathing Simulation Overview:

This simulation script demonstrates how our AI matching service can be used to recommend freelancer profiles to companies and mission posts to freelancers. It uses two main data arrays:

Freelancers: An array of freelancer objects, each containing a name and a profile (a description of skills and experience).
Missions: An array of mission objects, each containing a title and a description.

How the Simulation Works:

Mission-to-Freelancer Matching

For each mission:

Iteration: The script iterates over all freelancer profiles.
Scoring: It computes an embedding-based similarity score between each freelancer's profile and the mission description.
Ranking: Freelancers are then sorted in descending order based on their similarity scores.

Detailed Analysis: the top match is further analyzed using the ChatCompletion function to provide detailed insights (strengths, gaps, and an overall match score).
Freelancer-to-Mission Matching
For each freelancer:

Iteration: The script iterates over all mission descriptions.
Scoring: It computes a similarity score between the freelancer's profile and each mission.
Ranking: Missions are sorted in descending order based on their similarity scores.
Detailed Analysis: the top mission is analyzed in detail using the ChatCompletion function.
